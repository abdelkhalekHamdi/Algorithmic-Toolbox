# Greatest Common Divisor
The greatest common divisor GCD(a, b) of two non-negative integers a and b
(which are not both equal to 0) is the greatest integer d that divides both a and b.
Your goal in this problem is to implement the Euclidean algorithm for computing
the greatest common divisor.
Efficient algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor is an important
basic primitive of commonly used cryptographic algorithms.
